# Angular Reusable Library

This project is a very demonstration of a reusable Angular library.
The "buttons" project in this workspace contains a library of components and modules which are exposed through a public api interface.
The "testing" project is a simple frontend application that demonstrates the ability to use the library's components outside of the project.

## Getting Started

To host the "testing" frontend locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run "ng build buttons" in the terminal
3. Run "npm run package"
4. Run "ng serve testing"
