# Angular Reusable Library

This project is a very basic demonstration of a reusable Angular library.

The "buttons" project in this workspace contains a library of components and modules which are exposed through a public api interface.

The "testing" project is a simple frontend application that demonstrates the ability to use the library's components outside of the project.

## Getting Started

To host the "testing" frontend locally:

1. Clone the repo and cd into it
2. Run "npm install"
3. Run "ng serve testing"
